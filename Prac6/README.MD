# Task 1: Cuboid [10]

For this task, you are excepted to create a cuboid template class called Cubiod that is capable of determining the volume and surface area of itself. The template type will dictate the precision of all members and return values.

Let m and M denote member's types, and method's return types respectively, of the cuboid class. Then m ∈ T and M ∈ T, where T is any type with defined addition **(+)** and multiplication **(*)** operators.

You must create a file `"cuboid.h"` where the template class is to be declared. All implementation must be defined inline in the class declaration (i.e. inside the h - file). The class requires at least three members to store the relevant scalar values of each dimension. Do not provide getters or setters for these members. Furthermore the constructor needs to receive three parameters that denotes the width, height, and length in no particular order. Two methods, getVolume and getSurfaceArea, need to be implemented that calculates and returns the volume and surface area of a cuboid object respectively.

On completion, create a tarball containing **cuboid.h** only. Upload it using the active fitch-fork assignment called **Practical 6 - Cuboid**.

# Task 2: Linked Bar Graph [20]

For this practical, students are expected to create a typical bar graph using linked lists. You have been provided with an h - file. This file contains 3 errors that you need to fix before you can continue. The h - file defines a struct node which will be used to form the x-axis of the bar graph. Each node has a label and a value which indicates the hieght of the bar for that particular label. You are expected to implement the functions indicated in the h - file. DO NOT CHANGE THE GIVEN FUNCTIONS. Student may add helper function if needed. Each function has a description in the h - file to indicate what is expected of you. Finally, make your own main to test the functionality of your program. On completion, create a tarball containing **xAxis.h** and **xAxis.cpp**. Upload it using the active fitchfork assignment called **Practical 6 - Linked Bar Graph**.
