# Task 1: Cuboid [10]

For this task, you are excepted to create a cuboid template class called Cubiod that is capable of determining the volume and surface area of itself. The template type will dictate the precision of all members and return values.

Let m and M denote member's types, and method's return types respectively, of the cuboid class. Then m ∈ T and M ∈ T, where T is any type with defined addition **(+)** and multiplication **(*)** operators.

You must create a file `"cuboid.h"` where the template class is to be declared. All implementation must be defined inline in the class declaration (i.e. inside the h - file). The class requires at least three members to store the relevant scalar values of each dimension. Do not provide getters or setters for these members. Furthermore the constructor needs to receive three parameters that denotes the width, height, and length in no particular order. Two methods, getVolume and getSurfaceArea, need to be implemented that calculates and returns the volume and surface area of a cuboid object respectively.

On completion, create a tarball containing **cuboid.h** only. Upload it using the active fitch-fork assignment called **Practical 6 - Cuboid**.
