# Task 2: Linked Bar Graph [20]

For this practical, students are expected to create a typical bar graph using linked lists. You have been provided with an h - file. This file contains 3 errors that you need to fix before you can continue. The h - file defines a struct node which will be used to form the x-axis of the bar graph. Each node has a label and a value which indicates the hieght of the bar for that particular label. You are expected to implement the functions indicated in the h - file. DO NOT CHANGE THE GIVEN FUNCTIONS. Student may add helper function if needed. Each function has a description in the h - file to indicate what is expected of you. Finally, make your own main to test the functionality of your program. On completion, create a tarball containing **xAxis.h** and **xAxis.cpp**. Upload it using the active fitchfork assignment called **Practical 6 - Linked Bar Graph**.
